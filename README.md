## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a good small project to work on on few things such as working with lists, tables, fonts, styling individual elements and tables, although my final implementation didn't include a traditional html table. It was also good to work on a design that has some changes between mobile and desktop implementation which proved a bit more challenging than expected at times.
